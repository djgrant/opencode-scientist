# Iterative Loop

## The Loop

1. **Evaluate** - Understand current state (screenshot, read output, check files)
2. **Hypothesize** - Write down what you think is happening and what will fix it
3. **Act** - Conduct the experiment
4. **Verify** - Check result against your hypothesis
5. **Repeat** - Until goal achieved

## Tracking Progress

Create a work package, and within it track the iterations:

```markdown
# Goal
{What you are trying to achieve}

## Current Hypothesis
{What you think is happening and what will fix it}

## Iterations

### Iteration {n}
- Hypothesis: {what you thought would happen}
- Observed: {what actually happened}
- Action: {what you did}
- Result: {what happened}
```

Update this as you iterate.

## Exit When

- Goal achieved
- Hypothesis proven wrong with no alternative
- Diminishing returns
